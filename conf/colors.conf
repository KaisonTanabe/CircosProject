# RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# by their name. In order to use a color,you must define it here. 
#
# Common colors (red,green,blue,etc) are already defined in 7
# tones,based on 7 color Brewer palettes,where available.
#
# vvlHUE (very very light HUE,e.g. vvlred)
# vlHUE (very light HUE,e.g. vlred)
# lHUE  (light HUE,e.g. red)
# HUE   (e.g. red)
# dHUE  (dark HUE,e.g. dred)
# vdHUE (very dark HUE,e.g. vdred))
# vvdHUE (very very dark HUE,e.g. vvdred))
#
# Boutique colors are not. If you really must use 'bisque',then add
#
# bisque = 255,228,196
#
# See colors.unixnames.txt for a large number of named color definitions.
#
# In addition to hues,two other color groups are defined. 
#
# - cytogenetic band colors (e.g. gposNNN,acen,stalk,etc.) which
#   correspond to colors on ideogram bands
# - UCSC chromosome color palette (e.g. chrNN,chrUn,chrNA)
#     - included from ucsc.conf
# 
# Another useful list of colors is in brewer.conf,which defines
# Brewer Palettes (www.colorbrewer.org),and corresponding lists.
